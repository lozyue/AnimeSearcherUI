# AnimeUI Document with part of source.

This is the User Guidance Document of senior use.

And you can find part of the source code about utils and themes respectively 
in the `src` and `animeUI/themes` directory.

Here is the online service available: [AnimeSearcher](https://zaxtyson.github.io/AnimeSearcher/) 

To deploy it, you may use this branch [webui](https://github.com/lozyue/AnimeSearcherUI/tree/webui)


## AuiPlayer Available

AuiPlayer is an online HTML5 player that support danmaku, subtitle, playlist and whatever features on AnimeUI.
Meanwhile, it's hard to split AuiPlayer as a single project.

Anyway, AuiPlayer and AnimeUI will be always pure, pretty and neat.

To specialize the behavior of AuiPlayer(or AnimeUI), it is recommend to deploy your own instance rather than the giving online service above.
In that way you can custom the global configuration and establish a theme style as default following the [API Document](https://lozyue.github.io/AnimeSearcherUI/theme-dev/style/api-config.html#auiplayer)

However, now you can use `<iframe>` to imbedding AuiPlayer into your application:
